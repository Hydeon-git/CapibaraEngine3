# Welcome to CapibaraEngine 3

## Intro

In this page you will find every piece of information regarding CapibaraEngine3, a university project made by a team of three students completing the degree in "Videogame Development an Desing" more speciphically the subject "3D Engines" at the Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnología Multimedia or CITM in Terrassa, Catalunya.

- Holding SHIFT duplicates movement speed.


### Editor Windows

- Console: The console LOGS the geometry loading process.


### Configuration

- A graph for the frames per second.

- Configuration for all variables on each module (renderer, window, input, textures).

- Information output of memory consumption, hardware detection and software versions (SDL, OpenGL, DevIL).

- Exit option in general menu to exit the engine.


### Models and .fbx Import

- Basic Shape primitives: Cube, Pyramid and Sphere.

- Drag & Drop functionallity.

- .fbx Objects can be loaded and be visible in the engine.

- 3 different .fbx models included in the engine (/Assets folder).

- BakerHouse is automatically loaded at the start.



## The last assignment

Due to the engine being done under a university project the diferent teams have a diferent sub system to program, in our case we are programing an scripting system for the third and last delivery, every student in our class agreed to fork their projects from the [Ragnar Engine](https://github.com/UriKurae/Ragnar-Engine) and their original owners were:
