## Intro

In this page you will find every piece of information regarding CapibaraEngine3, an university project made by a team of three students of Video Game Design and Development Degree, for the subject "3D Engines" at the Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia (CITM) in Terrassa, Catalunya.

## Main Core Sub-systems

## 1st Assignment - Geometry Viewer

### Models and .fbx Import

- Basic Shape primitives: Cube, Pyramid and Sphere.

- Drag & Drop functionallity.

- .fbx Objects can be loaded and be visible in the engine.

- 3 different .fbx models included in the engine (/Assets folder).

- Baker_house was automatically loaded at the start.

- Two models in FBX format with one channel diffuse texture.

- Drag&drop of FBX files from anywhere in the Hard Drive.

- Drag&drop of DDS/PNG files.

- GameObject structure, one for each loaded mesh. Each GameObject having 3 display-only components: Transform, Mesh and Texture.


### Camera

- While Right clicking, WASD to move around the scene.

- Mouse wheel for zoom in and zoom out.

- Holding SHIFT duplicates movement speed.

- Alt+Left click to orbit around the object.

- "F" to focus the camera around the geometry.


### Editor Windows

- Console: The console LOGS the geometry loading process.


### Configuration

- A graph for the frames per second.

- Configuration for all variables on each module (renderer, window, input, textures).

- Information output of memory consumption, hardware detection and software versions (SDL, OpenGL, DevIL).

- Exit option in general menu to exit the engine.


### Hierarchy window

- Displaying a list of all GameObjects

- GameObject selection


### Inspector

- Displays information about the components of the selected GameObject

- Transform: only for display purposes. Show position, rotation and scale for the selected GameObject.

- Mesh: information about the loaded mesh. There should be an option to display its normals (per-triangle and per-face).

- Texture: display texture size and path. There should be an option to view the selected GameObject with the checkers texture.


### Menus

- About window with github link and information about the engine

- Option to turn on/off editor windows


## 2nd Assignment - Engine Editor
On the second assignment we forked our project from our teacher [Rubén Ajenjo](https://github.com/solidajenjo/), who provided us a fresh project to continue developing CapibaraEngine under all 1st Assignment demands.

This project was forked from https://github.com/solidajenjo/Engine3D.

- The "Street environment" was loaded at the start automaticaly

- The user can now use the inspector to modify a Gameobject's:

· *Hierarchy*: Deleting, reparenting, creating emptys or creating children.

· *Transform*: Traslading, rotating and scaling GameObjects.

· *Mesh* :  Selecting and/or droping any imported mesh.

· *Texture*: Selecting and/or dropping any imported texture.

· The Camera as a component.

- GameObjects can be picked using the mouse.

- All meshes use AABB and can be discarted using Frustrum Culling(visualized in the editor).

- Models, Meshes and Textures saved in our own "Library" folder

- Scene serialized to a file to be loaded.

- Start/ Pause/ Stop mechanics added to the simulation and recovering original state.

- Editor with 2 windows: Editor view / Main in game camera viewing at the same time.


### Resource Management

- “Assets” window  showing all user assets.

- The user can drop/import new files.

- Asset files can be deleted through the window.

- Upon start, all resources not managed inside Assets are generated in Library.

- All resources use reference counting, this process is visualized in the editor.



## 3rd Assignment - High Level System

In the 3rd assignment the diferent teams from the class had a diferent sub system to develop, in our case our task was the scripting system for our engine. In our case the team developing [Ragnar Engine](https://github.com/UriKurae/Ragnar-Engine) kindly provided us their project to be forked.

Their respective Github usernames are:

- Oriol Bernal ([UriKurae](https://github.com/UriKurae))

- Lucas Pérez ([LucasPG14](https://github.com/LucasPG14))

###  General Contents

- Full Engine's Website

- Default window at 1024 x 768 centered on the screen

- Resizable window.

- Build Loads directly from the scene


### Scripting Contents


(Image of the in-game Tank)

- Tank moves using the keyboard (W,A,S,D).

- Tank shoots with Left Click on the mouse(Bullets are new GameObjects and have lifetimes).

- In-editor text window to edit scripts.
