# Welcome to CapibaraEngine 3

## Intro

In this page you will find every piece of information regarding CapibaraEngine3, an university project made by a team of three students of Video Game Design and Development Degree, for the subject "3D Engines" at the Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia (CITM) in Terrassa, Catalunya.


## Team Members
The first two original members of the CapibaraEngine are:

- [Albert Pou](https://github.com/Hydeon-git)

## Main Core Sub-systems


## In the first assignment


### Models and .fbx Import

- Basic Shape primitives: Cube, Pyramid and Sphere.

- Drag & Drop functionallity.

- .fbx Objects can be loaded and be visible in the engine.

- 3 different .fbx models included in the engine (/Assets folder).

- Baker_house was automatically loaded at the start.

- Two models in FBX format with one channel diffuse texture.

- Drag&drop of FBX files from anywhere in the Hard Drive.

- Drag&drop of DDS/PNG files.

- GameObject structure, one for each loaded mesh. Each GameObject having 3 display-only components: Transform, Mesh and Texture.


### Camera

- While Right clicking, WASD to move around the scene.

- Mouse wheel for zoom in and zoom out.

- Holding SHIFT duplicates movement speed.

- Alt+Left click to orbit around the object.
-
- "F" to focus the camera around the geometry.


### Editor Windows

- Console: The console LOGS the geometry loading process.


### Configuration

- A graph for the frames per second.

- Configuration for all variables on each module (renderer, window, input, textures).

- Information output of memory consumption, hardware detection and software versions (SDL, OpenGL, DevIL).

- Exit option in general menu to exit the engine.


### Hierarchy window

- Displaying a list of all GameObjects

-GameObject selection


### Inspector

- Displays information about the components of the selected GameObject

- Transform: only for display purposes. Show position, rotation and scale for the selected GameObject.

- Mesh: information about the loaded mesh. There should be an option to display its normals (per-triangle and per-face).

- Texture: display texture size and path. There should be an option to view the selected GameObject with the checkers texture.


### Menus

- About window with github link and information about the engine

- Option to turn on/off editor windows


## In the second assignment











## The last assignment

Due to the engine being done under a university project the diferent teams have a diferent sub system to program, in our case we are programing an scripting system for the third and last delivery, every student in our class agreed to fork their projects from the [Ragnar Engine](https://github.com/UriKurae/Ragnar-Engine) and their original owners were: 

- Oriol Bernal ([UriKurae](https://github.com/UriKurae))

- Lucas Pérez ([LucasPG14](https://github.com/LucasPG14))
